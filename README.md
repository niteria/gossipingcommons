# Gossiping Commons

*Ever wondered if you can share a gossip? Now there is a license framework for that!*

"WORK" IN PROGRESS (feel invited to join, contribute, or distract me)

It was intended to be for the April Fools' Day (2019), but I didn't take this deadline too seriously.
Plus, you know, it is hard to compete with all these corporate adverts.


## Example licenses

### No author please, and don't tell anyone

It if is a secret, it is a secret! So, don't tell anyone anything. Especially that you know that from me!

I mean, I know can share with Max, because I am are sure they won't share it with anyone!

### Don't tell all of that

The best way to protect privacy is to make sure all derivative work has changes, step by step, making in indistinguishable.

The power of gossips is the creative spirit of exaggerations, misheard words, wrongly attributed intentions, and stuff.

E.g. "A friend of mine solicited her student to act in an adult movie with pterodactyls."

Well, if we trace the creative chain, the last version I know... well, I cannot tell pervious versions.

### Don't be Judas, no exaggerations

Workplace "wisdom of crowds" has different rights. You really want to be free from slanders, and have your career intact. By a rat backstabbing you in an exchange for a company meeting in Bali.

Writing or of your (true!) stories you told them during integration parties, writing blog posts changing the protagonist name to their own, and monetizing on adverts would not be cool.

Also, selling your friend for ₿3.0 is not cool. And well, if you use this license, it is also illegal.
